# About

A place to hold whatever plugins I end up using. [source](https://www.nushell.sh/book/plugins.html)

# How-To

Plugin names have to begin with `nu_plugin` & are added with `register`

```nushell

register ./config/nushell/nu_plugin_foo

```

Sample plugins [are in the repo](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/tree/main/crates/nu_plugin_example)
